# UI/UX Design System Skill

This skill guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that strictly avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to mathematical precision, material depth, and creative intentionality.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, commit to a **BOLD** aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this solve?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: Brutalist, Minimalist, Maximalist, Retro-futuristic, Luxury/Refined, Editorial/Magazine, Industrial, etc.
- **Differentiation**: Identify the one "unforgettable" element that defines the design.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### 1. Strict Color Economy (Max 6 Colors)
- **Constraint**: Use **no more than 6 distinct colors** (including background, text, and accents).
- **Strategy**: Establish a clear hierarchy: Dominant, Sub, and Accent. Use CSS variables to maintain this palette.
- **Impact**: Achieve extreme visual cohesion through restraint rather than abundance.

### 2. Typography & Mathematical Order
- **Font Selection**: Avoid "safe" system fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial). Pair a characterful display font with a refined body font.
- **Rhythm**: Apply a strict **8pt Grid System** or **Golden Ratio** scales for spacing and sizing.
- **Micro-Typography**: Refine kerning, line-height, and letter-spacing to create a professional, "designed" feel.

### 3. Materiality & Tactility
- **Physicality**: Move beyond "flat" design. Simulate textures such as glassmorphism, brushed metal, or grain overlays.
- **Lighting**: Define a consistent light source. Use multi-layered shadows and subtle highlights to create volume and depth that feels tangible.

### 4. Motion Physics & Narrative
- **Spring Physics**: Use natural easing (e.g., spring-based animations) rather than linear transitions.
- **Staggered Reveals**: Use `animation-delay` to orchestrate a sequenced entry of elements, creating a narrative flow for the user's eye.

### 5. Anti-AI Slop Checklist
- **Reject the Default**: Avoid purple-on-white gradients, generic rounded cards, and predictable layouts.
- **Intentional Friction**: Introduce "grid-breaking" elements or asymmetrical compositions that signal human-centric design.

## Live Review Workflow

When reviewing implemented interfaces:
1. **Audit Color**: Does the UI stay within the 6-color limit?
2. **Audit Typography**: Is the scale mathematically consistent and the font choice distinctive?
3. **Audit Material**: Does the interface have depth, or does it feel "flat and generic"?
4. **Interaction Check**: Do hover states and transitions feel responsive and weighted (not floaty)?

**IMPORTANT**: Elegance comes from executing a vision with precision. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic direction and never settle for common, average choices.
